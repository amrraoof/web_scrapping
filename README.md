# web_scrapping
## My_projects in web scrapping during my learning journey
## The first code with the name `scraping_data_from_coreyms` scraps data from coreyms.com and split these data into 3 parts [headlines, summaries, youtube link]
## The website is seperated into 10 sections
## Headlines are the headlines of every section in the website
## summaries are brief descriptions of sections
## Youtube links are videos explaining every section
# Image scrapping jupyter file scraped image and downloaded it
